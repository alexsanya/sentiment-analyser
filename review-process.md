# Pull Request Review Process

This document outlines the comprehensive review process for pull requests in this open source Python project. Use this as a checklist to ensure high-quality code contributions.

## üîç General Review Guidelines

### Code Quality Fundamentals
- [ ] **Readability**: Code is self-documenting and easy to understand
- [ ] **Consistency**: Follows existing project conventions and style
- [ ] **Simplicity**: Implements the simplest solution that meets requirements
- [ ] **DRY Principle**: Avoids code duplication without over-engineering
- [ ] **Single Responsibility**: Functions and classes have clear, focused purposes

### Change Impact Assessment
- [ ] **Scope**: Changes are focused and don't introduce unrelated modifications
- [ ] **Backwards Compatibility**: Existing functionality remains intact
- [ ] **Breaking Changes**: Properly documented and versioned if necessary
- [ ] **Performance Impact**: No significant performance regressions
- [ ] **Resource Usage**: Memory and CPU usage are reasonable

## üêç Python-Specific Standards

### Code Style & Formatting
- [ ] **PEP 8 Compliance**: Follows Python style guide (use `flake8` or `black`)
- [ ] **Line Length**: Maximum 88-100 characters per line
- [ ] **Import Organization**: Imports grouped and sorted (stdlib, third-party, local)
- [ ] **Naming Conventions**: 
  - `snake_case` for functions, variables, modules
  - `PascalCase` for classes
  - `UPPER_CASE` for constants

### Type Annotations & Documentation
- [ ] **Type Hints**: All public functions have type annotations
- [ ] **Docstrings**: All public modules, classes, and functions documented
- [ ] **Docstring Format**: Follows Google or NumPy style consistently
- [ ] **Return Types**: Clearly specified for all functions
- [ ] **Exception Documentation**: Custom exceptions are documented

### Python Best Practices
- [ ] **Context Managers**: Use `with` statements for resource management
- [ ] **Exception Handling**: Specific exceptions caught, not bare `except:`
- [ ] **List/Dict Comprehensions**: Used appropriately without sacrificing readability
- [ ] **F-strings**: Modern string formatting over `%` or `.format()`
- [ ] **Pathlib**: Use `pathlib.Path` instead of `os.path` for file operations

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design

### SOLID Principles
- [ ] **Single Responsibility**: Each class/function has one reason to change
- [ ] **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- [ ] **Interface Segregation**: No forced dependencies on unused methods
- [ ] **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Design Patterns & Structure
- [ ] **Appropriate Patterns**: Design patterns used correctly, not over-engineered
- [ ] **Module Organization**: Logical file and package structure
- [ ] **Configuration Management**: Settings externalized and environment-aware
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling strategy across the codebase
- [ ] **Logging**: Appropriate log levels and structured logging where applicable

### Dependencies
- [ ] **Minimal Dependencies**: Only necessary external packages added
- [ ] **Version Pinning**: Dependencies properly versioned in requirements/pyproject.toml
- [ ] **License Compatibility**: All dependencies have compatible licenses
- [ ] **Security Assessment**: Dependencies scanned for known vulnerabilities

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: All new functions and methods have unit tests
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Key workflows have integration test coverage
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and error cases tested
- [ ] **Coverage Threshold**: Maintain minimum 80% test coverage
- [ ] **Test Quality**: Tests are independent, repeatable, and fast

### Test Organization
- [ ] **Test Structure**: Tests mirror source code structure
- [ ] **Test Naming**: Descriptive test names explaining what is being tested
- [ ] **Test Data**: Use fixtures and factories for test data generation
- [ ] **Mocking**: External dependencies appropriately mocked
- [ ] **Parametrized Tests**: Use `pytest.mark.parametrize` for multiple inputs

### Testing Best Practices
- [ ] **AAA Pattern**: Arrange, Act, Assert structure in tests
- [ ] **One Assertion**: Each test focuses on one specific behavior
- [ ] **Test Independence**: Tests don't depend on each other's state
- [ ] **Cleanup**: Resources properly cleaned up after tests
- [ ] **Performance Tests**: Long-running operations have performance tests

## üîí Security Considerations

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- [ ] **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized
- [ ] **SQL Injection**: Parameterized queries used for database operations
- [ ] **Path Traversal**: File paths validated to prevent directory traversal
- [ ] **Command Injection**: Shell commands properly escaped or avoided

### Secrets & Configuration
- [ ] **No Hardcoded Secrets**: API keys, passwords not in source code
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data loaded from environment
- [ ] **Secret Scanning**: Code scanned for accidentally committed secrets
- [ ] **Configuration Security**: Default configurations are secure

### General Security
- [ ] **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Known CVEs addressed
- [ ] **Least Privilege**: Code runs with minimal necessary permissions
- [ ] **Error Information**: Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] **Logging Security**: Sensitive data not logged in plain text

## üìö Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Public interfaces clearly documented
- [ ] **Complex Logic**: Non-obvious code sections have explanatory comments
- [ ] **TODO Comments**: Include issue numbers and timeline for TODOs
- [ ] **Examples**: Usage examples provided for complex functions

### Project Documentation
- [ ] **README Updates**: Changes reflected in project README if applicable
- [ ] **Changelog**: Significant changes documented in CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] **Migration Guides**: Breaking changes include migration instructions
- [ ] **Architecture Docs**: Significant architectural changes documented

## ‚ö° Performance & Efficiency

### Performance Considerations
